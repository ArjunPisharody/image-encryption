# image-encryption
This project is a Python-based tool for encrypting images using simple encryption techniques. The tool provides multiple methods for encrypting images, including pixel swapping and basic mathematical operations (addition and multiplication). It leverages the Pillow library for image handling and NumPy for efficient pixel manipulation.

Features
Pixel Swapping: Randomly swaps pixels within the image to create a scrambled effect.
Pixel Modification: Allows you to add or multiply pixel values to alter the image's appearance.
File Format Support: Handles images in PNG, JPG, and JPEG formats.
Customizable: Allows you to choose the encryption method and parameters.
